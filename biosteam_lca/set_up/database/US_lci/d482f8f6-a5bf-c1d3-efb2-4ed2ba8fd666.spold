                    <text xml:lang="en" index="1">This process produces cotton lint; at harvest in 2003; at farm; 90%-93% moisture. The process is assumed to represent production in Alabama (US State). Yields and related inputs and outputs represent a single year of operation, in 2003. This dataset includes consideration of residue burning; soil preparation; planting or sowing; irrigation; application, storage, and transport of fertilizers, manures, liming materials, secondary materials, and pesticides; and harvest.  Fate and transport of applications are not included as described in Cooper, J.S., Kahn, E., Noon, M. (2012) LCA Digital Commons Unit Process Data: field crop production Version 1 which is available at https://www.lcacommons.gov/discovery/docs/LCA%20Digital%20Commons%20Unit%20Process%20Data%20final%20updated.pdf</text>

                <samplingProcedure>A delete-a-group jackknife is used by the USDA to estimate the ARMS sample means and RSEs, based on a 15 sample delete-a-group jackknife.   Because of this relatively small sample size, a Students t distribution is used to represent ARMS data probability density functions.  Other representations of uncertainty are described in Cooper, J.S., Kahn, E., Noon, M. (2012). LCA Digital Commons Unit Process Data: field crop production Version 1.
