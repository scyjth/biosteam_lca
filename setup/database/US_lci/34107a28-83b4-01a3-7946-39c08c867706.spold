                <samplingProcedure>A delete-a-group jackknife is used by the USDA to estimate the ARMS sample means and RSEs, based on a 15 sample delete-a-group jackknife.   Because of this relatively small sample size, a Students t distribution is used to represent ARMS data probability density functions.  Other representations of uncertainty are described in Cooper, J.S., Kahn, E., Noon, M. (2012). LCA Digital Commons Unit Process Data: field crop production Version 1.
