This unit process/ gate-to-gate dataset represents the production of 1 kg spring wheat (excl. durum) coproduced with residue.  The process technologies are an aggregation of those applied in South Dakota in 2009. Applicable classifications include ISIC 0111, NAIC 111140, UNSPSC 50221101; this dataset was prepared in ILCD format using the UWDFE Lab Excel to ILCD File Generator (beta version, August 2013)

                <samplingProcedure>A delete-a-group jackknife is used by the USDA to estimate the ARMS sample means and RSEs, based on a 30 sample delete-a-group jackknife.   Because of this relatively small sample size, a Students t distribution is used to represent ARMS data probability density functions.  Other representations of uncertainty are described in Cooper, J.S., Kahn, E., Noon, M. (2012). LCA Digital Commons Unit Process Data: field crop production Version 1.  Prepared for the US Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Library.
