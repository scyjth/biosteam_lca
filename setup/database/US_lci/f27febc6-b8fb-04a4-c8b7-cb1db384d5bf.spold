                <samplingProcedure>A delete-a-group jackknife is used by the USDA to estimate the ARMS sample means and RSEs, based on a 15 sample delete-a-group jackknife.   Because of this relatively small sample size, a Students t distribution is used to represent ARMS data probability density functions.  Other representations of uncertainty are described in Cooper, J.S., Kahn, E., Noon, M. (2012). LCA Digital Commons Unit Process Data: field crop production Version 1.  Prepared for the US Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Library.  Retrieved from https://www.lcacommons.gov/discovery/docs/LCA%20Digital%20Commons%20Unit%20Process%20Data%20final%20updated.pdf</samplingProcedure>
                <extrapolations>Data represent an aggregation of processes applied in Missouri in 1998. Data development is demonstrated by parameterization (exlicitly presents all raw and uncertainty data and all calculations). Flow data quality according to the LCADC convention is provided for all flows.</extrapolations>
